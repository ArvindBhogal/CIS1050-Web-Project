    <p style="font-size:19px">Here's where there will be a brief description of the controls and base mechanics of this game, mostly information that's taught to you right from the get go. You can normally clear the first seven chapters of the game with just knowing these.</p>

<div class="transBox" style="height:900px;">
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Jump</h2>
        <img src="resources/jump.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">This one's simple enough. Jumping lifts you off the ground, and you can do a 'short hop' by tapping jump instead of holding it. You can bind Jump to any or even multiple buttons, which some people find helpful for speedrunning purposes. You cannot jump again when you're in the air, but the game takes care of that as well...</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/dash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">And here's the thing that really makes this game a platformer. Dashing gives you a burst of speed in the direction that you're holding. You can dash left, right, up, down, and diagonally, giving you 8 different ways to dash. You can also dash on the ground without having to jump. After a dash, the character's hair turns blue, indicating that you are unable to dash for as long as it stays blue. Once you touch the ground again or collect a green floating crystal, you regain your red hair and thus your dash. Combined with jumping, dashing is one of the cornerstones of any advanced technique.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Climb</h2>
        <img src="resources/climb.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">By holding the Climb button, you can temporarily hold onto a wall and climb up and down, or jump, even after a dash. This helps the player reach places that are potentially too far away to get to by dashing upwards. However, climbing reduces your stamina, and once you're out, your character starts flashing red and you'll be unable to hold walls until you touch the ground again.</p>
