Or do you just want to see the cool stuff that makes Celeste Speedrunning fun to both watch and play? Welcome to Advanced Techniques, where I'll show you the many crazy and super fast things you can do to play the game <i>really</i> well.</p>

        <h2>Super Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/superdash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">The easiest advanced technique, a Super Dash is executed by pressing jump and dash at the same time. Done properly, a single dash will go much further and with more height than a normal dash, making it quicker to close distance and height. You can jump diagonally up to increase the distance travelled a little bit.</p>

        <h2>Super Wall Jump</h2>
        <img src="resources/superwalljump.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">A Super Wall Jump is executed by dashing upwards alongside a wall, and jumping while the momentum of the dash is still carrying you upwards. If done correctly, you'll jump upwards with much more momentum at the cost of your dash. Similarly to the Super Dash, this closes the gap quicker than normally climbing or jumping and dashing upwards, and is overall much more applicable throughout the game. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Hyper Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/hyperdash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 50px;">The bread and butter of Celeste speedrunning. In a similar concept to Super Dashing, the player has to jump and dash at the same time. For a Hyper Dash however, the player also has to be jump-dashing diagonally downwards (in the case of the demonstration to the left, I am holding diagonally down and left). Hyper dashing provides a speedboost and forsakes the height gain from super dashing for increased speed and distance, resulting in much quicker movement.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Wave Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/wavedash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">If you've ever played <i>Super Smash Brothers Melee</i> or <i>Rocket League</i> competitively, odds are you've heard of this term already. Wave Dashing is done by jumping up into the air and dashing diagonally downwards to the ground. At the exact moment of landing, jump towards the direction you are heading. If done correctly, you will gain a speedboost like a Hyper Dash but keep your dash. This has advantages over Hyper Dashing in that by keeping your dash, you can dash again after already getting the boost from the Wavedash, allowing for some more distance covered and even potential skips.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Ultra Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/ultradash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Despite being one of the harder techniques to both execute and utilize well in speedrun practice, this can get you some real speed. Ultra Dashing is done by diagonally dashing downwards while having a high horizontal velocity (such as the momentum gained from a wavedash). Doing it correctly allows the player to not only maintain their speed instead of the usual velocity reset, when the player touches the ground they also get a speed boost. Despite its difficulty, there are various places that the ultradash can be utilized to improve times, and TAS (Tool Assisted Superplay) runs can do some incredible stuff with the momentum gained from ultradashing. </p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Demo Dash</h2>
        <img src="resources/demodash.gif">
        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">The most precise trick here and definitely one of the least practical, but if done in the right places it can save a HUGE amount of time. A Demo Dash is simply a crouched dash, which squeezes the character hurtbox to just the same height as the gaps between some kill walls like the one shown to the left. To execute, you would have to press down, and <i>in 3 frames</i> dash. If you dash too late, you will simply dash downwards. Not even kidding, this is ridiculously hard to pull off, and most applications require a setup and TONS of practice, but show great results when it finally starts working.</p>
