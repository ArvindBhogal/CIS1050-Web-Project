Couple things to note:

FOR IDEAL VIEWING PURPOSES, MAKE SURE YOU VIEW THE SITE AT 1280x720 RESOLUTION.

With the exception of the Youtube Links, all gifs and the video in the <video> element were recorded and added by me. 

Footage is of the game "Celeste" by Matt Makes Games. 

The sketch provided is common throughout all the pages, with the major difference being the actual content of the subsections and how long they extend.
