    <p>So you might have heard of the game called <i>Celeste,</i> produced by Matt Makes Games. It's an indie platformer with charming 8-bit graphics and highly dynamic and challenging gameplay, along with some very compelling dialogue.
    If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend you go ahead and do so. It's available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Playstation 4 for a maximum price of $25.
    If you have played it, but want to learn more about the speedrunning world (or if you already know speedrunning and want to read anyways), then read on!</p>

            <p>Click on the strawberry or the link on the Navigation Bar to see an overview of the basic controls and mechanics of this game. Definitely recommended before looking at Advanced Techniques.</p>

<!-- For whatever reason, the .column img class was giving me stretched images when I put in "height:140px;width:140px;" in the stylesheet, but is giving out normal
pictures when I put it as an inline style. Hopefully you can let that bit go.
