    <p style="font-size: 19px;">Bruh. You somehow managed to go to a page that doesn't exist. That's what 404 means, page not found. In any case, if you're having problems with the site, make sure to contact Theo (not me, I'm Madeleine) via the following email address with an inquiry: <a href="#" style="color:green">theounderstars@celeste.com</a>. If you want to get out of here and go back to learning about speedrunning, the Navigation Bar at top should help you do that. What are you waiting for? Let me climb the mountain in peace.</p>

<div class="transBox">
    <p>With the fact that the contact email is presented above, there's really no point to having this here. Theo, get yourself together man.</p>
